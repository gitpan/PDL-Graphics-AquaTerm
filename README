PDL/Graphics/AquaTerm version 0.02
==============================

This module interfaces PDL directly to the AquaTerm Mac OS-X graphics terminal.
It is primarily intended for quickly and easily displaying pdls as bitmap
images. If all you desire is to be able to call AquaTerm functions from Perl 
you might instead be interested in Graphics::AquaTerm, currently distributed 
along with AquaTerm itself from SourceForge.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the AquaTerm graphics display program available
from Sourceforge and a reasonably recent version of the PDL module.
